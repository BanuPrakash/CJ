Agenda:

Day 1: Web application development using Maven, RDBMS for CRUD operations

Day 2, 3, and 4: Spring Boot 3.x with JPA for persistence

Day 5: Spring Security and Introduction to MicroServices.

==========================================

Web Application Development:

JSE --> Java Standard edition
JEE --> Java Enterprise Edition
* Web application development using Servlet API
* Enterprise Java Bean [EJB] for distributed computing 
* JNDI
* ...

Web application development:
1) Server Side Rendering
* Server sends the presentation pages for the data
* Pros:
Thin clients, SEO
* Cons:
Can't have heterogenous clients like Mobile/ Tv/ Desktop / Web
* Heavy payload

2) Client Side Rendering
* send different formats of representation of data like JSON / XML / RSS / ATOM / CSV

==============

Servlet APIs provide a way to build Server side java applications.

HttpServletRequest ans HttpServletResponse objects are created by the Servlet engine for every request.
HttpServletRequest: encapsulates all data coming from client [ client specific data, Browser, OS]
HttpServletResponse: used to write data back to client

HttpServletRequest ans HttpServletResponse objects are attached to a Thread: ThreadLocal

==============

How does the engine know which Servlets to instantiate and map URL to servlet --> Deployment descriptor: XML or Annotation

Life cycle management of Servlets are done by the Servlet engine/web container
--> By default all Servlets are Singleton
--> All Servlets are multi threaded

web.xml -> one per web application
```
    <servlet>
		<servlet-name>first</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>pkg.LoginServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>first</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
```
Annotation : @WebServlet("/login")


Maven / Gradle are build tools:
manage dependencies, execute goals like compile, testing, packaging,...

jakarta.servlet-api --> provides Servlet API
HttpServlet, Servlet, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletReponse

lombok --> code generation library

mysql-connector-j --> Mysql Implementation class for integrating Java <---> Mysql

---
Packaging --> jar / war / ear / sar

Web archive --> war --> understood by Servlet engine / Web container

+----+-------------+--------+


``

DriverManager.getConnection() factory method to establish a database connection
Statement --> SQL which is fixed, no IN parameter
PreparedStatement --> SQL which takes IN parameter
select * from users where username = ? and password = ?
select * from products where price > ?

executeUpdate() -- INSERT , DELETE and UPDATE SQL
executeQuery() -- SELECT

JSP pages --> Static + dynamic content

======================================================

MVC Architectural Pattern
Model --> Business data and business logic
View --> Presentation layer [HTML, CSS , JS and JSP ]
Controller --> Application Logic [ flow of application ] --> Servlet and Filter

Server Side Redirection: One resource within the engine is redirecting to other resource with in the engine
ForntController redirects to list.jsp:
 req.getRequestDispatcher("list.jsp").forward(req, resp);

Server Side Redirection can be used for multi stage processing


===========

Http protocol is a stateless protocol. Once response is committed HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects are destroyed. There is no conversational state of client.

Session Tracking: Ability given to server side applications to keep track of conversational state of client.

HttpSession API provides mechanism for session tracking

===========

Protected resources:

Filter --> Servlet API are used for interceptor pattern, generally used for cross-cutting concerns like
logging, security, profile, encrption, encoding,...

Listeners: executed automatically when certain events happen within the Servlet Engine

```
ServletContext: Environment where serlvets are managed
public class ContextInit implements ServletContextListener {
    @Override
    public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) {
        // this code is executed as soon as Servlet Context is created
        Database Connection pool
        User Thread pool
    }

    @Override
    public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent sce) {
        // when servlet context is destroyed
    }
}

public class UserInit implements HttpSessionListener {
    // called whenever session is created or destroyed
}
```

Web application development: Servlet, JSP , HTML , Filter and Listener

SOLID Design Principle:
S --> Single Responsibility
O --> Open Close Principle [Closed for Change, but open for extension]
L --> Liskov Substitution Principle: 
    Generalization and Specialization relationship. A Specialization component can replace the Generalization and still get the work done what Generalization does.

    BankingAccount is Generalization
    SavingsAccount is Specialization
    LoanAccount is Specialization
    CurrentAccount is Specialization

    If I am able to login and logout using BankingAccount, I should be able to perform these operarions using Savings, loan and Current account

    If BankingAccount has credit() and debit(), this fails Liskov Substitution Principle
I --> Interface seggregation
D --> Dependency Injection using IoC Container
Inversion of Control

Web Container already uses DI.
HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects are injected to Servlet and Filter

UI --> Service ---> Repository / DAO --> Database connection

=============

Day 1 Recap:
```
Web application development wrt to Java 
Servlet API: Servlet, JSP, Filter and Listeners are termed as web components of JEE
Servlet Container / Web Container / Servlet engine --> JETTY / TOMCAT and NETTY 

Servlet Container manages life cycle of Servlet APIs like instantiating Servlets, HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.
Also DI of request and response objects are handled by Servlet Container

Servlet/ Filter --> Controller
JSP/HTML, CSS and JS --> View
Java Bean [business data and logic] --> Model

client side forwarding : response.sendRedirect()
server side forwarding: request.getRequestDispatcher("resource").forward(req, resp)

HttpSession API: to track conversational state of the client

```

Spring Framework: provides Spring Container to manage life cycle of beans and dependency injection.
Bean --> any object managed by spring framework is a bean.

Why Spring Framework?
1) application can be built using loosely coupled objects 
2) Reduces a lot of boiler plate code.
3) provides many templates for Enterprise Application dev.
4) Declarative style of programming instead of programmitic

Spring framework uses XML / annotation as metadata for  manage life cycle and DI.

```
    interface EmployeeDao {
        void addEmployee(Employee e);
    }

    public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao {
        public void addEmployee(Employee e) {
            ..
        }
    }

     public class EmployeeDaoMongoDbImpl implements EmployeeDao {
        public void addEmployee(Employee e) {
            ..
        }
    }

    public class AppService {
        private EmployeeDao empDao;

        public void setEmpDao(EmployeeDao edao) {
            this.empDao = edao;
        }

        public void doTask(Employee e) {
            empDao.addEmployee(e);
        }
    }

```

beans.xml

```

    <beans>
        <bean id="mongo" class="pkg.EmployeeDaoMongoDbImpl" />
        <bean id="jdbc" class="pkg.EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl" />
        <bean id="service" class="pkg.AppService">
            <property name="empDao" ref="jdbc" />
        </bean>
    </beans>

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");

AppService ser = ctx.getBean("service", AppService.class);

ser.doTask(new Employee(...));

```

==============

Annotations as meta-data:
Spring is going to instantiate objects if it finds any of the below annotations:
1) @Component
2) @Repository
3) @Service
4) @Controller
5) @RestController
6) @Configuration
7) @ControllerAdvice

Wiring can be done using @Autowired or using constructors

```
  interface EmployeeDao {
        void addEmployee(Employee e);
    }

    @Repository
    public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao {
        public void addEmployee(Employee e) {
            ..
        }
    }

    @Service
    public class AppService {
        @Autowired
        private EmployeeDao empDao;

        public void doTask(Employee e) {
            empDao.addEmployee(e);
        }
    }

```

```

ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.scan("com.cisco.prj");
ctx.refresh();

AppService ser = ctx.getBean("service", AppService.class);

ser.doTask(new Employee(...));

    @Service
    public class AppService {
        // Constructor DI
        public AppService(EmployeeDao empDao) {
            this.empDao = empDao;
        }
    }


```

Advantage of using @Repository --> ErrorCode to proper exceptions

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-jdbc/src/main/resources/org/springframework/jdbc/support/sql-error-codes.xml

Without Spring and @Repository

```
    // Oracle
    try {


    } catch(SQLException ex) {
        if(ex.getErrorCode() == 1) {
            throw new DuplicateKeyException("...");
        }
    }
    // MySQL
    try {


    } catch(SQLException ex) {
        if(ex.getErrorCode() == 1062) {
            throw new DuplicateKeyException("...");
        }
    }

```

Spring Boot framework is built on top of Spring Framework
Spring boot 2.x is built on Spring Framework 5.x
Spring boot 3.x is built on top of Spring Framework 6.x

Why Spring Boot?
Highly opiniated framework, lots of configurations comes out of the box.
Example:
* While building JDBC based applications, database connection pool is configured  out of the box.
* While building Web applications 
1) Embedded Tomcat container is configured out of the box.
2) FrontController is configured and ready to use
3) Provides Java <--> JSON conversion HttpMessageConverter
* many more ...
* Easy to Dockerize

====

@SpringBootApplication is 3 in one:
1) @ComponentScan
2) @EnableAutoConfiguration
3) @Configuration


Problem:

```

Field employeeDao in com.cisco.springdemo.service.AppService 
    required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- employeeDaoJdbcImpl: 	
    - employeeDaoMongoImpl:

```

Solution 1: Using @Primary
Mark one of the eligible ones as @Primary

```

@Repository
@Primary
public class EmployeeDaoMongoImpl implements EmployeeDao{
@Repository
public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao{

```

Solution 2: using @Qualifier

```

@Repository
public class EmployeeDaoMongoImpl implements EmployeeDao{
@Repository
public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao{   


@Service
public class AppService {
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("employeeDaoMongoImpl")
    private EmployeeDao employeeDao;

```


Solution 3: @Profile

```

@Repository
@Profile("prod")
public class EmployeeDaoMongoImpl implements EmployeeDao{

@Repository
@Profile("dev")
public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao{

@Service
public class AppService {
    @Autowired
    private EmployeeDao employeeDao;

application.properties
spring.profiles.active=dev

```

Solution 4: @ConditionalOnMissingBean

```

@Repository
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(EmployeeDaoMongoImpl.class)
public class EmployeeDaoJdbcImpl implements EmployeeDao{

@Repository
public class EmployeeDaoMongoImpl implements EmployeeDao{

```

==================

Factory Methods:
If 3rd party objects has to be managed by spring container, or object creation is complex then we need factory methods.

DataSource --> Pool of database connection
DriverManager --> to establish a single connection; latency involved in establishing connection and releasing.


DataSource: C3p0, Hikari, DriverManagerDataSource , ....

=============================================

Spring Framework integrating with ORM Framework.

ORM Framework: Object Relational mapping
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that converts data between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language. 

class is mapped to database table
fields are mapped to columns of database.

ORM frameworks helps generate DDL and DML statements, no need to write SQL.

ORM Frameworks: 
* Hibernate is by JBoss [RedHat]
* TopLink is by Oracle
* KODO is by BEA [ acquired by Oracle ]
* JDO is by Sun [ acquired by Oracle ]
* openJPA by Apache
* Eclipselink


Spring Boot JPA module is using Hibernate by default [ opiniated framework]
and HikariCP for database connection pool [ opiniated framework]

JPA: Java Persistence API is a specification for ORMs, like an layer/interface for ORMS

ORMs eliminate scaffolding codes like establishing connection, Statement, handling exceptions and also releasing resources..

=======================

```

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean emf(DataSource ds) {
        LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean emf = new LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();
        emf.setDataSource(ds);
        emf.setPackagesToScan("com.cisco.prj.entity");
        emf.setJpaVendor(new HibernateJpaVendor());
        ...
        return emf;
    }

    // factory method
    @Bean
    public DataSource getDataSource() throws Exception {
        ComboPooledDataSource cpds = new ComboPooledDataSource();
        cpds.setDriverClass( "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" ); //loads the jdbc driver
        cpds.setJdbcUrl( "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cj" );
        cpds.setUser("root");
        cpds.setPassword("Welcome123");
        cpds.setMinPoolSize(5);
        cpds.setAcquireIncrement(5);
        cpds.setMaxPoolSize(20);
        return  cpds;
    }
}


```

Spring Data JPA configured along with JPA /ORM simplifies using ORMs.
No need to write @Repository classes. we just create interfaces, implementation classes are generated by Spring Data JPA.

==============

Spring Boot application:
Dependencies:
1) MySQL
2) JPA
3) Lombok

1) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Map to existing table.
If required alter table
If table doesn't exist create a table

Can be used for Top to bottom apprach

2) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
create tables when application starts, delete them them on application terminate.
Good for testing environment

3) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=verify
Map to existing tables in database. Exact matching has to be there.
No alter or creation of new tables.
DBA controls the Database.
Used for Bottom to Top approach.

with Spring Data JPA we just need interfaces, implementation class [@Repository] are generated:

```

```

public interface CustomerRepo extends JpaRepository<Customer, String> {
}

public interface ProductRepo extends JpaRepository<Product, Integer> {
}


```

======

CommandLineRunner is a Spring interface used to execute code after the Spring Boot application context has been loaded and before the application starts serving requests.

Settings:
build, Execution, deployment --> Annotation Processors
orderapp--> Obtain processors from classpath


==========

@Transactional is required for any custom mutation to the database table like insert, delete or update
default for built-in JpaRepository methods it's enabled --> Auto commit is set to true.


Association Mapping: entities are associated
* One-to-many
* many-to-one
* one-to-one
* many-to-many

Domain Driven Design
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html

@JoinColumn used with @ManyToOne introduces FK in owning entity
@JoinColumn used with @OneToMany introduces FK in child entity 

https://www.database-answers.com/data_models/


```
Assume 1 order has 4 items
 @OneToMany
    @JoinColumn(name="order_fk")
    private List<LineItem> items = new ArrayList<>();

to save: 
orderRepo.save(order);
itemRepo.save(i1);
itemRepo.save(i2);
itemRepo.save(i3);
itemRepo.save(i4);

to delete:
orderRepo.delete(order);
itemRepo.delete(i1);
itemRepo.delete(i2);
itemRepo.delete(i3);
itemRepo.delete(i4);

```

With Cascade:

```
   // order has many items
    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name="order_fk")
    private List<LineItem> items = new ArrayList<>();

Order has 10 items
to Save:
orderRepo.save(order); // takes care of saving all 10 line items

to delete:
orderRepo.delete(order); // takes care of delete all 10 line items of order
```
Complete orderRepo
Build RESTful Web services for order application

Client sends ORder in XML or JSON format:

```
    order date is system date
    total has to be computed
    amount of line item has to be computed
    {
        "customer": {"email": "anne@cisco.com"},
        "items": [
            {
                "product": {"id": 3},
                "qty" : 2
            },
            {
                "product": {"id": 1},
                "qty" : 3
            },
        ]
    }

    <order>
        <customer>
                <email>anne@cisco.com</email>
        </customer>
        <items>
            <line-item>
                    <product id="3">
                    <qty>
                            2
                    </qty>
            </line-item>
        </items>
    </order>

```

Dirty checking: within @Transactional boundary if entity becomes dirty / change, automatically ORM will send UPDATE SQL

By default ManyToOne is EAGER fetched and OneToMany is Lazy loading

Example: Fetching Order has fetched Customer also but not it's line items

@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name="order_fk")
    private List<LineItem> items = new ArrayList<>();

====

Building RESTful Web services.

REST REpresentational State Transfer, architectural style for distributed systems.
Roy Fielding in 2000.

Prior to REST - SOAP was used
SOAP APIs have several disadvantages, including complexity, performance overhead, and lack of flexibility compared to REST APIs.

```
<soap:Envelope
xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding">

<soap:Header>
...
</soap:Header>

<soap:Body>
...
  <soap:Fault>
  ...
  </soap:Fault>
</soap:Body>

</soap:Envelope>

```

* Resource: Any information that we can name and present on server is a resource
* Representation: state of the resource at a given point of time
    * data --> printer is On
    * metadata --> data is 2kb and in JSON format
    * hypermedia --> URIs to switch on / off / print the printer
* Content Negotiation: different formats of Representation requested by the client

Guiding principles of REST:
1) Uniform Interface:
    /users/123 identifies an user resource with id 123

2) client server decoupling.

3) Stateless: No session tracking , no converstational state of client

4) Cacheable

5) Layered System


Spring Boot application with JPA and Web:
Dependencies:
1) MySQL
2) JPA
3) Lombok
4) web

====================

```

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>

    This Modules provides:
    1) Embedded Tomcat Servlet Container
    alternatives: Jetty and Netty
    2) Jackson library for Java <---> JSON
    alternatives: GSON, Jettison and Moxy
    3) DispatcherServlet as FrontController Servlet
    4) HandlerMapping
```

Settings:
build, Execution, deployment --> Annotation Processors
orderapp--> Obtain processors from classpath

Use @Controller for Traditional web application develeopment --> Server Side rendering
use @RestController for RESTful WS --> Client side rendering

URI to identify the resource and HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations

1) GET http://localhost:8080/api/products
Accept: application/json

get all products

2) GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/4
get product whose id is 4 --> Path Parameter ( / )

3) GET http://localhost:8080/api/products?page=1&size=10
paginated products / sub set --> QueryParameters (?)

4) POST http://localhost:8080/api/products
Accept: application/json
Content-type : application/json

payload contains the new product to be added to products resource

5) PUT http://localhost:8080/api/products/3
For major update
payload contains the new product information to be update  to a product whose id is 3 

6)  PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/products/3
for partial update
payload contains the partial product information to be update  to a product whose id is 3 

7) DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/3
delete a product whose id is 3 / AVOID DELETE operation as API

GET and DELETE -> No Payload --> Safe methods --> IDEMPOTENET
PUT / PATCH and POST --> contains payload --> Not Safe methods

```
    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("api/products")
    public class ProductController {
        @GetMapping()
        public List<Product> getProducts() {
            return service.getProducts();
        }

        @PostMapping
        public @ResponseBody Product addProduct(@RequestBody Product p) {
            return service.addProduct(p);
        }
    }

@ResponseBody is optional

```

JSON Patch is a standard format for describing changes to a JSON document. It's typically used with the HTTP PATCH method to apply partial updates to resources on a web server. 

The specification (RFC 6902) defines a set of operations (add, remove, replace, move, copy, test) that can be applied to a JSON document. 

```
    Employee
    {
        id: 125,
        title: "Jr Developer",
        "personal": 
            {
                "phone": "123444"
            },
            "programmingSkills": [
                "Java",
                "JavaScript"
            ]
    }
    JsonPatch
    https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/10/10/unlocking-the-power-of-json-patch

    [
        {"op": "replace", "path": "/title", "value" : "Team Lead"},
        {"op": "remove", "path": "/personal/phone"},
        {"op": "add", "path": "/personal/email", "value":"smitha@cisco.com"},
        {"op": "add", "path" : "/programmingSkils/1" , "value": "AWS"}

    ]

```
Task:

CustomerController to add a customer and get all customers
customers.http to test

GET, POST, PUT , PATCH, DELETE

CRUD
CREATE -- POST
READ --- GET
UPDATE -- PATCH / PUT / JSONPATCH 
DELETE -- DELETE
==========================

Cross Cutting Concerns
Cross-cutting concerns are functionalities that are needed in multiple parts of an application, but don't directly contribute to the core business logic.
-- Logging, Transaction, security , profile 

Cross cutting concerns leads to code tangling and code scattering

```
    public void transferFunds(Account from, Account to, double amt) {
        log.info("Transfer funds called!!!");
        if(ctx.getPriciple() != null) { / /security
            tx.beginTransaction();
                double amt = from.getBalance();
                log.info("Current balance : " + amt);
                from.withdraw(amt);
                to.deposit(amt);
                log.info("transfered money!!!);
            tx.commit();
        }
     }

```

Aspect Oriented Programming
```

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that enhances modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns, which are functionalities that affect multiple parts of a program
Aspect:
A module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, or transaction management. 
Join Point:
A specific point in the execution of a program where an aspect can be applied. Examples include method calls or exception 
handling. 
m1, m2, m3, m4 and EntityFoundException

Pointcut:
An expression that defines which join points an aspect should be applied to. 
m2 and EntityFoundException


Advice:
The code that is executed at a join point. There are different types of advice, such as before, after, around, afterthrowing, etc. 



@ControllerAdvice : meant to handle exceptions propagated from @Controller and @RestController --> It is a special @AfterThrowing advice. It is HttpServletRequest and HttpServletREsponse aware

BindingResult is an interface in Spring Framework used to hold the results of binding and validation when binding request parameters to an object (e.g., a form or DTO). It provides methods to check for validation errors and retrieve error details.

When you use @Valid or @Validated annotations to validate request data, BindingResult acts as a container for validation errors and gives you fine-grained control over how to handle them in your controller.

  @Version
    private int version;

ORM frmaeworks automatically updates the version each time mutation happens on entity using ORM
```
+----+----------------+---------+------+---------+
| id | name           | price   | qty  | version |
+----+----------------+---------+------+---------+
|  1 | iPhone 16      | 75000.9 |   95 |       0 |

We can use @Version for Etag and Caching
We can use this for handling data corruption in concurrency

First Commit wins
